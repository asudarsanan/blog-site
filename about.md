## Hi Namaste!

I’m Aasish, known online as ` asudarsanan ` on most platforms. I’m a Software Engineer who loves building interesting projects and is working on becoming better at creating valuable tools.

I typically work on the platform side of the spectrum, where I build developer tools, manage system states, and operate Kubernetes (k8s), ECS, and other technologies that keep your pods running, while you sleep peacefully.

Feel free to stick around if something here catches your interest!
